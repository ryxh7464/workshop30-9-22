### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

### Exercise 1

*Remove this text, and add your answer for Exercise 1 here.*

```{r plastic-waste-continent, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```

### Exercise 2

```{r plastic-waste-density}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.18)
```

### Exercise 3

We defined color and fill in the mapping aesthetics as they depend on continent, however we define the alpha value as a characteristic of the plotting geom as we want it to be a fixed value, regardless of continent.

### Exercise 4

The violin plots allow us to see the density of the points of the dataset. 

```{r plastic-waste-violin}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_violin()
```

### Exercise 5

The relationship between plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita is a positive correlation.

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
                     y = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged-continent}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
+        mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
+                      y = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap, colour = continent)) +
+     geom_point()
# colour the continent
```

```{r plastic-waste-population-total}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = total_pop, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r plastic-waste-population-coastal}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = coastal_pop, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Exercise 8

```{r recreate-viz}
plastic_waste_edit <- plastic_waste %>% 
  mutate(coastal_pop_prop = coastal_pop / total_pop) %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap < 3)
