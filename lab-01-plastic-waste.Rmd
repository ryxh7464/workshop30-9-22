### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

### Exercise 1

*Remove this text, and add your answer for Exercise 1 here.*

```{r plastic-waste-continent, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```

### Exercise 2

We defined color and fill in the mapping aesthetics as they depend on continent, however we define the alpha value as a characteristic of the plotting geom as we want it to be a fixed value, regardless of continent.

```{r plastic-waste-density}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.18)
```
